"""Corrections applied to open3e's datapoint definitions on the way in.

open3e's database is the authority on layout, and nothing here changes that.
What it does change is metadata open3e leaves blank because it does not need
it: units, and the enumeration behind a sensor's error byte. Both matter here
because Home Assistant builds its entity out of them -- a value with no unit
gets no device class, no statistics and no place on a dashboard.

Two rules only, both narrow, both verified against the whole database rather
than guessed:

  * A leaf with no unit whose datapoint name says what it measures gets that
    unit. 131 fields gain one; the 530 that already have one are never
    touched.
  * A subfield named `Error` becomes an enumeration over `SensorStates`. All
    twenty datapoints in the database with such a field are named `*Sensor`
    and carry a single byte there, so the rule cannot catch anything else.

Applied in two places that must not drift apart: gen_dpdb.py patches the JSON
that becomes the firmware's database, and the fixture generators patch the
Python codec objects they compare against. Skipping the second would make the
test suite fail on a difference that was intended.
