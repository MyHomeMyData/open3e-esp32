/* Firmware update over the web interface.
 *
 * The board lives in a boiler room, so an update that boots into something
 * broken must not require a USB cable to recover. Two mechanisms cover that:
 *
 *  - The image is written to the *other* app partition; the running one is
 *    untouched until the new image has been written and verified in full.
 *  - The bootloader's rollback support is enabled, so a new image that never
 *    reports itself healthy is reverted on the next reset. ota_mark_healthy()
 *    is what makes it permanent, and it is only called once the device is
 *    actually reachable again.
