/* Wi-Fi provisioning and connection management.

 * First boot has no credentials, so the device raises its own access point
 * with a captive portal; the browser opens the setup page by itself.  After
 * the credentials are saved the device reboots into station mode and is
 * reachable as <hostname>.local.
 *
 * If the stored network cannot be joined -- the router changed its password,
 * or was replaced -- the device falls back to the setup access point instead
 * of retrying silently.  Without that, reconfiguring means opening the boiler
 * room cabinet and plugging in a USB cable.
